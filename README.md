## Important Notes

### üîê API Key Security
Your OpenAI API key is **never stored on the server**. The key is:
- Stored only in your browser's localStorage
- Sent directly to OpenAI's API through our proxy route
- Never logged or saved on our backend

You can verify this by checking the [API route code](app/api/openai/route.ts) - the key is only used to make requests to OpenAI and is not persisted anywhere.
